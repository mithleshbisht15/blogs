          <p>As we are thinking all the time. There are lots of good and bad ideas that arise in our minds. Sometimes we feel like, we should share these ideas with others or ask others about what to do next. In short, we are confused, whether to do it or not. We have uncertainty that, what if these ideas didn’t work? The more you think different ideas, the less clarity you had.</p><br>

          <p>There are some decisions, where we want to share it with anyone, who at least listen & help us to tell which direction is best. Probably, that doesn’t work all the time, you may face failure or may get success.</p><br>

          <p>Therefore, it’s better to listen to the sound of soul ” Intuition” and later, if we face failure, let’s blame ourselves.
          In most of the decisions, our mind tries to tell us which one is best, sometimes we feel them and do accordingly but, sometimes we ignore them, or maybe our inattentive nature not allow us to listen to them.</p><br>

          <p>Moreover, in our everyday surroundings, there are lots of intuition that come in our mind. Like, Have you ever felt, that someone is staring at you & when you turn around, there is actually someone. Have you ever think that this is not right, it will not work and later on, it actually didn’t work.
          These are intuitions. You feel them and share with others because you believe that it could happen. Therefore, in several situations, intuition helps us to make decisions.</p><br>

          <p>Now, there are few questions arise like Where, How, and Why these intuitions came from? Should we trust them or avoid them?
          Intuition is a feeling that arises suddenly in many forms. Sometimes, we referred them as- Not feeling well, or according to some belief few people think that if there foot or hand is shivering, or if their eye is twitching then, there may be chances of something happening. It is more of a feeling than facts and figures.</p><br>


          <p>Furthermore, The more experienced a person is, the more he/she can observe & recognize something. Have you notice that our grandparents are more experienced and seen more world than us. Therefore, their intuition or Gut feeling is more powerful. We are not born with an equal level of intuition. It came from experience & keep developing as we go through life.</p><br>

          <p>According to researchers, Intuition is a powerful feeling & gives more confidence that helps us to make better decisions.
          But you should not rely on them, sometimes it may wrong. So, consider some facts & figures while making any decisions by knowing the limits of intuition that when to rely on it, and when not to.</p><br>
