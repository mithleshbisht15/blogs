          <p>We are not what we were before. Our food, fashion, lifestyle, from infancy to adultness, from schools to colleges, & then a job, everything has changed. We can’t expect anything to remain unchanged. Even our body, friends, family, plants, and animals change with time. We have to adjust ourselves to them.</p><br>

          <p>Some changes are good and some are bad, but it could not last forever. we don’t see our hairs, nails, plants & animals are growing. We assumed and feel them. Consequently, life is uncertain, it has changed and it will change with time. Either it may be natural or due to human activity.</p><br>

          <p>However, most people do not want changes in their life. If they are happy, they want to remain happy. Obviously, everyone wants that but when circumstances are not well then you have to understand that it will change too. Most people give stress to themselves because they think that they are going to live their whole life like that.</p><br>

          <p>Sometimes, we cannot control the changes that happen in life. We have to adjust ourselves in every circumstance as it is good for our growth and development. Like, changes in young children’s life begin when they are sent to school. Most of the time they are not ready to go to school, as it is good for their development they have to adjust to them. A plant needs sunlight and water to grow. If for weeks or months they either get sunlight or water, then do they grow well? Obviously, Not.</p><br>

          <p>Changes may be slow or fast. As a living being, plant, and human both have to adjust themselves throughout life.</p><br>


          <p>Further, Changes may also positive or negative. Sometimes it happens randomly or due to our activities. we need to look for an opportunity to work with positive change and handle the negative changes.</p><br>

          <p>Nowadays, When it comes to bad changes. People become stressed half of their life and the rest half of their life spent by living in the past. They need to understand that, whatever happens, has to happen you cannot stick in one direction. Forget about the past and future, learn to live at present and that is the best way to cure any situation.</p><br>


          <p>It is neither about letting go nor about grasping in the first place. It’s just that we need to be adaptable to the changing nature of reality.</p><br>

          <p>Always remember, ” EVERY CLOUD HAS A SILVER LINING.”</p><br>
