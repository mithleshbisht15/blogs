          <p>We always considering Quitting as a failure or looser. Because we grew up as listening and understanding like this. Sometimes, we considered it as losing confidence, Fear, Discomfort, and Unrealistic Experiences and there are other people also, who take it as a negative attribute.</p><br>

          <p>However, you cannot consider quitting as a right or wrong decision until you get to know about the reason behind it. Definitely, if you are quitting because of Fear, and Past Experiences, then it is wrong. But sometimes when you are not getting interested in particular work or might be that work would not right for you, then quitting is correct.</p><br>

          <p>Everyone knows that making a decision that you want to quit by your own reasons is tough. Probably, If you are making such a decision for the right thing is appropriate and make sure your risks are worth it.</p>
          <br>

          <p>When we are about to quit, we decide to begin something. Everyone teaches us,” Not Giving Up.” They say It’s okay If you will fail, but at least try it. But why we invest our time, where our soul and mind are not ready to do it.</p><br>

          <p>There is so many super Successful Entrepreneur like Bill Gates, Steve Jobs, & Mark Zukerberg, who dropped out of college and later become successful. Let’s take the example of Steve Jobs. His love for Machine and dedication to study only in that particular field makes him successful.</p><br>


          <p>He never enjoyed school. He went to college but dropped out after Ist semester. After dropping he continued attending the classes in which he is interested.</p><br>

          <p>Consequently, Mark Zuckerberg and Bill Gates both are very good at academics but as their interest in Programming and Computers respectively. They work hard and focus on that field and became successful.</p><br>


          <p>When you have Passion and want success in it, you must have the Willingness, Hardwork & Determination. </p><br>

          <p>Further, Quitting doesn’t mean giving up. It’s just that you move your attention and learning on something more valuable for you.</p><br>


          <p>Sometimes, the idea of Quitting comes in our mind when we believe that there is another important thing which we have to do first, but it doesn’t mean that the rest of the things are not important. At that time, might be your first priority is to do that work only. Like, there are only 24 hours in a day and sometimes, we have lots of work to do and that’s why we quit one or two work.</p><br>


          <p>Moreover, when it comes to quitting or switching jobs. Most people take it as a negative attribute, as it is the only way of earning. And if there is no job, there is no earning. In fact, they are not wrong as it is the only way to grow up financially.</p><br>

          <p>Quit when you have passion, when you willingly want to achieve it, or when you believe in yourself.</p><br>
