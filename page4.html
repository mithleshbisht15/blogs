          <p>The World has become noisier than it already is and there are lots of Rush in social media or in our daily activities. We are surrounded by a lot of information that, if we ever try to remember them, we cannot remember for long.</p><br>

          <p>Have you ever felt that you should go to a place where there is peace? Generally, those people who stay in a noisy environment tend to get stressed quickly and that’s why they lose concentration in their actions. 
          However, Most people relax their Brain and body by listening to music, even then if they stop the song their brain does not calm, it retrieving the lyrics by creating an illusion of sound.  </p><br>

          <p>It is not possible that your brain completely turns off. It’s just that, if your mind is peaceful, it will focus on the sound that comes inside your brain and when it is in rush, it will focus on the external noise around your surroundings.
          As everything around us is so noisy & louder. Many of us seeking silence. Few listen to music to quiet our minds, few spend time themselves, and there are few others, who like to spend time with nature.</p><br>

          <p>When our Brain is in silence. It relieves stress and tension, motivates you to perform better at work, and helps you to increase your concentration level. On the other hand, when your mind is not peaceful, means when a lot is going in your mind, the power to listen and understand becomes weak.</p><br>

          <p>According to research, Noise pollution creates many health problems like, increase blood pressure, sleep loss, & heart disease.</p><br>


          <p>Consequently, sometimes it is better to take a break from your work, and other activities and make your mind calm, as it enhances your creativity, thinking power, create awareness of self and environment, and ability to solve problems.</p><br>
