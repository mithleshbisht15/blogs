          <p>At an early age, we decide to achieve big dreams. At that time, we are not aware of how much failure or success that we can face. But soon when the time is right, we have to work hard to achieve our dreams, then we ignore them and make excuses. Because first, it needs lots of hard work, Secondly you don’t need to be asked to do only those things in which you are skilled.</p><br>

          <p>If we want to grow in our life & career. There must be the development of our skills. We only like to do those things in which we are comfortable or we are skilled at.</p><br>

          <p>After Graduation, you can get a job and do your job happily, but sitting at only one place and doing work every day without any development doesn’t make sense. It actually blocks your skills which means you are not able to think differently. We always want to perform better than the people who are around us and that will be possible if we will do something which is beyond our comfort zone.</p><br>

          <p>No Doubt, Sitting in one place and doing work, maybe comfortable and many people don’t want to leave it, but it keeps you from growing.</p><br>

          <p>Comfort Zone is a routine that acquires minimum risk & stress. Obviously, everyone wants to be in that kind of zone where you feel relaxed.</p><br>


          <p>Within your comfort zone, everything seems to ease.</p><br>

          <p>At the same time, we also know which thing we can’t do and we not even try to do those things. Maybe because we are afraid of failure or we don’t want to take a risk.</p><br>

          <p>People like Bill Gates and Steve Jobs are successful because they did something which is beyond their comfort zone. They get out of their comfort zone, take risks & willingly do the things to go after dreams.</p><br>

          <p>Therefore, to do something that makes you different in thousand of people only happen when you kill you fear of not trying.</p><br>

          <p>Whenever there is a Guest lecture in schools or colleges. The guest who used to come to give a guest lecture, When he/she ask questions, sometimes we would know the answer, but we did not answer. Because we are afraid of being asked again.</p><br>

          <p>Sometimes, we miss the opportunity to gain new skills because we are not challenging ourselves. we don’t want to take anxiety or stress related to our growth and development.</p><br>

          <p>Moreover, the work that gives stress, we try to complete it in several ways. We expand our minds, push our boundaries just to make it finish. Sometimes little stress doesn’ t harm us, in fact, it develops our skills.</p><br>

          <p>Well, as it is clear that for the growth and development of our career and life. We have to break our comfort zone by trying new things every day. Definitely, it is not easy to try new things, taking risks but it is not impossible at the same time.</p><br>
