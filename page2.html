          <p>When it comes to paying attention. Most of the people already ruin their minds by thinking of irrelevant matters, that doesn’t benefit them even later, it makes noise. Apart from working and earning money, we kept our mind very busy by focusing on useless things.</p><br>

          <p>We are giving so much power to the outside world by paying attention to the small things. We easily influence by thinking what another person thinks about us.</p><br>

          <p>If someone praises our qualities, we think that no one is better than us, and if someone disappoints us, we spend our whole day thinking about why he/she said this to us.</p>
          <br>

          <p>We give way to ourselves to the outside world so much that we forget what we are and what else we can do. We are making ourselves foolish by paying attention to other’s perceptions, and that’s how we lose our ability to think and grow.</p><br>

          <p>Moreover, there are lots of things where we need to pay attention like, to our family, friends, our work as they provide lessons, care, understanding, & encouragement to us. In short, we should give bearing attention from where our growth and development can happen, not the place where we can be stressed, & make our life miserable.</p><br>


          <p>Sometimes, after making a mistake, the realization happens that we made a mistake, then we waste all our time only thinking about that. We need to understand that no one is perfect. Everybody makes mistakes, maybe you are hurtful or not attentive.</p><br>

          <p>Another reason for paying attention to the wrong place is when you feel alone or when you want love & support from your loved ones, but you are not getting. Do not take these things seriously, try to find positiveness in every matter, it actually makes you feel happy. Therefore, spend time with your loved ones and always remember no one makes happy or sad, but you can do it yourself.</p><br>


          <p>Sometimes either we give attention to what people say to us or say to others. This can happen when you are not in the right circle. We are here to live our life fullest. So, try to fill it with the best experiences & best memories.</p><br>

          <p>Pay attention to the people who have a unique talent or from where you can learn something. We all learn from each other. Take every matter as an opportunity to boost your energy, uplift your confidence and growth.</p><br>


          <p>Thinking about the people, who do not even care about you is a full waste of time & energy. Secondly, you are making your mind weak by thinking about these things. At last, Do more rather than thinking or listening.</p><br>
